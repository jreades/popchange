PopChange: Enabling Small Area Comparisons of Census Data since 1971 for Great Britian

This repository contains the R code used to generate the grids from the original census geographies (output areas or enumeration districts) for the PopChange project. The [project website](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geography-and-planning/research/popchange/introduction/) contains more information on the research project including current research papers.

For information on how to use the code to generate your own grids, please see [Process for Running Code](process-for-running-code.md). 

Not making use of postcode accuracy field. 

Need to filter out large users as unlikely to be residential. 

Need to think what could be done with line features (roads and large rivers) to help suppress areas.
